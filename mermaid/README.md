# Image registration using pyTorch

Mermaid is a registration toolkit making use of automatic differentiation for rapid prototyping. It runs on the CPU and the GPU, though GPU acceleration only becomes obvious for large images or 3D volumes. 

# Basic installation

```diff
- We just changed the code to pytorch 0.4.0. So expect some issues.
- If you still want to run the old version, you can check out tag v0.2
- (which works with pytorch 0.3.0 and python 2.7 or 3).
- Going forward all development will be based on python 3 as well.
```

A basic installation requires the installation of a few python packages. Most of these packages can be installed via conda, but a few do not have conda installers, but can be installed via pip. 

  * conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
  * [for CPU only: conda install pytorch-cpu torchvision -c pytorch]
  * conda install future
  * conda install -c conda-forge itk
  * conda install sphinx
  * conda install pandas
  * conda install matplotlib
  * conda install scipy
  * conda install openpyxl
  * conda install -c anaconda cython
  * conda install -c anaconda scikit-image
  * conda install -c conda-forge tabulate
  * pip install pytorch-fft
  * pip install pynrrd
  * pip install scikit-posthocs

IMPORTANT: pytorch 0.4.0 is required. The code will no longer run on 0.2.0 or 0.3.0

 The mermaid.yaml file in the install directory also contains information for all the packages that need to be installed. We will provide an anaconda installer in the (hopefully) near future.

# Making the documentation

To create the documentation type `make html` in the docs directory. Requires installation of graphviz (https://www.graphviz.org/).

# An alternative way to install everything

*WARNING: This does not work yet and has not been updated for pytorch 0.4.0

It is of course also possible to install everything into a virtual conda environment. For this, do the following:

   * conda create -n mermaid-py27 python=2.7 pip
   * source activate mermaid-py27
   * cd install
   * pip install -r requirements_python2_osx.txt  [Pick the right one for your operating system]
   * pip install -r requirements_pytorch_fft.txt

We are working on making the code compatible with python3, which is currently *not supported*. Once it is supported it will be possible to install doing the following:

   * conda create -n mermaid-py36 python=3.6 pip
   * source activate mermaid-py36
   * cd install
   * pip install -r requirements_python3_osx.txt  [Pick the right one for your operating system]
   * pip install -r requirements_pytorch_fft.txt

# After the installation

After everything is installed, compile the documentation (there are also more detailed installation instructions) by doing the following.

      * cd mermaid
      * cd docs
      * make html

Lastly, to compile the spatial transformer code simply go to the pyreg/libraries directory \
  for gpu user: execute 'sh make_cuda.sh'
  for cpu user: execute 'sh make_cpu.sh'

CUDA can be enabled by setting CUDA_ON to True in settings/compute_settings.json. All settings are contained in json configuration files in the settings directory. 

# How to run registrations

There are a few example registration implementations in the demos directory. Actual applications are contained in the apps directory.

# Things to know

* Use float32 in most cases, float16 is not stable
* Most parts of the codes have been examined. In case of failure of the GPU code contact zyshen021@gmail.com; for all other failures contact mn@cs.unc.edu or open an issue in the github issue tracker.
